//Purpose: A collection of constants used by an event-driven simulation of
//cars flowing through an intersection managed by a traffic light.

//Event type constants

const int EVENT_CHANGE_GREEN_NS = 6;
const int EVENT_CHANGE_YELLOW_NS = 7;

//Car-related constants

//Direction-related constants
const std::string EAST_DIRECTION = "East";
const std::string WEST_DIRECTION = "West";
const std::string NORTH_DIRECTION = "North";

//Traffic light state constants
